        all related websites and applications that we offer you.</p>
    <p><strong>Service</strong> means the websites, applications and mobile websites or other online content, through

    <h3>2. What data do we collect about you?</h3>

    <h4>2.1 Data provided directly by you</h4>
    <p>During your registration to use the Services we provide, we may collect "Personal Information," which is hereby
        defined as "First name, Last name, phone number, Picture of Ghana Card, Age, Location and Password and any
        information that could be used to identify, contact, or locate you directly." By using the ASIDOR Platform, you
        are authorizing us to collect, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the ASIDOR Platform. Providing
        the above data is necessary to use the services offered as part of the ASIDOR account.</p>

    <h4>2.2 Communication via the chat function in our Platform:</h4>
    <p>When you use the chat feature to communicate with other users, we collect the message content and information you
        provide through this functionality. Telephone communication and correspondence: In the case of telephone, we do
        not collect all information that you decide to provide during a conversation or during correspondence with our
        employees or representatives.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Transaction Information</h3>
    <p>We collect transaction details related to your use of our Platform, such as the type of service requested,
        service provided, date and time of service, amount charged, distance traveled, intra-User communications,
        ratings and reviews, and other related transaction details. We share certain information with our partners who

        information we receive from background check of service providers for the purposes of assessing whether to
        permit an individual to use the ASIDOR Platform as a Provider and to comply with applicable law.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Data that we collect automatically when you use our Services</h3>
    <p>When you use our Platform, we automatically collect the following information about you.</p>

    <h4>2.5 Data about the device</h4>
    <p>We collect information about your device, such as the version of the operating system and unique identifiers. An
        example of this information is the name of the cellular network you use. Information related to the device is
        linked to your ASIDOR account.</p>

    <h4>2.6 Location information</h4>
    <p>Depending on the privacy settings of your device, if you put a specific item on our Platform, we automatically
        collect and process information about your current location. We use various technologies to determine the
        location, including IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi access points and mobile stations. We collect precise location data
        through the App when it is used by Customers and Providers if your devices permit such information collection.
        We may collect this information when Customers and Providers use certain functionality, such as navigating to a
        location to provide the Services, and we may also collect the precise location of a Provider's device when the
        App is running in the foreground or background. The ASIDOR Platform utilizes geo-location features to match
        Customers to Providers, to update Customers on the status of Providers enroute to perform Services and to
        improve our services. We also may use and disclose geo-location we collect for other business purposes,
        including for legal purposes (such as to enforce our agreements) and in the event of a proposed or actual
        merger, sale, or other business asset transfers. The geo-location information obtained about a User will be
        retained in an identifiable manner, along with geolocation data about job sites where Providers performed
        Services on initial and/or follow-up jobs. We collect technical details, including the internet protocol address
        (IP address) of your device, time zone information and operating system. We also store information about your
        login (date of registration, date of last change of password, date of last successful login) and type and type
        of your web browser.</p>

        in which you clicked, your interactions with such advertisements and product lists, time duration of your visit,
        as well as the order in which you visited individual sections of our Platform.</p>

    <h4>2.8 Cookies</h4>
    <p>We use cookies to manage user sessions, store language preferences and provide you with relevant ads. “Cookies”
        are small text files sent by the web server to the hard drive of your device. Cookies can be used to collect
        information about the date and time of your visit, your browsing history, your preferences, and username. You

    correspondence regarding our Services or transactions that you have
    with them (for example, shipping confirmation data, information on the
    discrepancy of goods with the advertisement, information on potential
    frauds).</p>

    <h3>3. Use of Information</h3>
    <p>We will use your personal data (this includes the information collected by our third-party service providers, set
        forth herein; however, which is governed separately) only if it is in accordance with the law. We usually
        process your personal information for purposes of our "use" include platform-analytics, marketing, advertising,
        and other purposes designed to help us efficiently operate and improve our Platform.</p>

    <p>We use your mobile phone number, login details and unique device identifiers to administer and protect our
        Platform (including diagnostics, data analysis, testing, fraud prevention, IT maintenance, support, reporting
        and data hosting). For the purposes of preventing abuse and promoting security by blocking spam or offensive
        messages that may be sent to you by other users, we analyze your communication through the chat function. We
        process the above information for the proper performance of the contract you have concluded with us, to improve
        our Services and based on the premise of our legitimate interest in the prevention of abuse.</p>

    <h3>4. Your rights</h3>
    <p>The applicable privacy laws grant you certain rights related to the processing of your personal data. The nature
        of our actions determines the scope of your rights.</p>

    <p>If you want to implement any of the rights described below, go to your account/privacy settings or contact us
        using the Contact Form.</p>

    <h4>4.1 The right to access your personal data</h4>
    <p>This right allows you to receive information about whether we process personal information about you and, if so,
        the right to receive a copy of the personal data we process. The right of access to personal data allows you to
        verify that we process them in accordance with the law.</p>

    <h4>4.2 The right to rectify your personal data</h4>
    <p>This right provides the opportunity to request correction of incomplete, untrue, or outdated data that we
        process. In some cases, when we process your request, we will need to verify the correctness of the new data you
        provide us with.</p>

    <h4>4.3 The right to limit the processing of your personal data</h4>
    <p>This right allows you to ask us to stop processing your personal data in the following situations:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>if you want us to check the accuracy of the data;</li>
        <li>if our processing is illegal;</li>
        <li>when you need the data to establish, investigate, or defend claims, even though we no longer need your data
            for our own processing purposes;</li>
        <li>when you object to our processing, but we must verify whether we still have overriding and legitimate
            grounds for continuing the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>4.4 The right to delete your personal data</h4>
    <p>This right allows you to request removal of your personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for
        which it was collected. You can also request that we delete your personal data if you have successfully
        exercised your right to object to the processing (see below) if we process your data unlawfully or are required
        to remove your personal data to comply with the legal obligation indicated in provisions of applicable law.</p>

    <h4>4.5 The right to object to the processing of data concerning you</h4>
    <p>In a situation where we process your data based on the premise of a legally legitimate interest (ours or third
        parties), you can lodge an objection for reasons related to your particular situation when, in your opinion, the
        processing affects your rights or freedoms. You also have the right to file an objection if we process your data
        for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we can demonstrate that we have a legitimate basis for processing
        data that overrides your rights and freedoms (e.g., the need to ensure the security of the Platform and the
        prevention of fraud). In such cases, the right to object is not connected with the removal of your personal
        data.</p>

    <h4>4.6 The right to transfer your personal data</h4>
    <p>In implementing this right, we will provide you or a third party identified by you with your personal information
        in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Remember that you are entitled to this right only in
        relation to data processed on the basis of consent or the condition for performance of the contract you have
        entered into with us, and the processing itself takes place in an automated manner (in information systems).</p>

    <p>If you have given us permission to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw it at any time.
        Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing which was carried out on the basis of
        consent before its withdrawal.</p>

    <p>The exercise of rights is, in principle, free: You will not have to pay a fee for exercising the right of access
        to your personal data (or for the performance of any other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if
        your request is manifestly unreasonable or excessive, in particular, because of its continuing nature. In these
        cases, we may also refuse to comply with your request.</p>

    <p>Timeline for requests: We strive to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. If your request is
        particularly complex or you have made several requests, it may take us longer than a month to recognize them. In
        this case, we will inform you about the extension of the deadline and provide you with current information
        regarding the implementation of your request.</p>

    <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority at any time.</p>
